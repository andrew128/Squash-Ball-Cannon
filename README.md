# Projectile Trajectory
![alt text](https://github.com/andrew128/projectileTrajectory/blob/master/CannonPic.jpg)

This python script is an implementation of Euler's method. 
It produces a graph of the trajectory of a projectile (squash ball) fired from our air-pressured cannon. 
The script takes the orientation of the cannon as input.
